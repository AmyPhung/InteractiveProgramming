# Project Proposal
## Main Idea
The concept of our project is a spin-off of the game Fruit Ninja, except the
players use a physical object to control how the fruits are sliced. We were
planning on exploring vision tracking, and collision detection in the game as
well as learn how to implement basic physics into our game. Our minimum viable
product is a game where players use their mouse to play a simple game of
Fruit Ninja, and our stretch goal is to allow players to use their hands as
the controller.

## Learning Goals:
Amy: Learn how to use the OpenCV library and learn about using python to make games

## Libraries:
We will most likely use pygame and OpenCV for our project.
